<h1>Learned How to Design a PCB</h1>
<h2>December 11, 2025</h2>
<h3>Spent:2.8Hours</h3>
<p>Today through youtube, I learned how to design a PCB on Kikad and started building my first PCB design. Before I worked with breadboard circuitry but never designed a PCB. The one I am designing right now is not related to any project. It's just an tutorial piece. I am gonna make my main project PCB next day. The whole circuitry is on my head right now.

<h1>Completed my first PCB</h1>
<h2>December 12, 2025</h2>
<h3>Spent:2.5Hours</h3>
<p>Today I completed my basic learning on building PCB and built an mini inverter PCB watching a tutorial. I leant how to make Gerber file and what to send to PCB manufacturer to manufacture my PCB. I hope from the next day, I can start building my project PCB.

<h1>Started making Schematics, researched on how to control AC.</h1>
<h2>December 13, 2025</h2>
<h3>Spent time: 4 Hours</h3>
<p>Today I started building my project PCB and done research on how to control AC average voltage with a TRIAC and ESP 32. Bought some things to practically learn about TRIACS.
